# teachable-machine
Using teachable machine for object detection
- this is just a simple test of TM using python
- important point that python needs to be in 3.7 or 3.6 for this to work
- installation scripts need to be run (use a virtual env!!)
- model trained only says up or down when you point
- pretty fun when figured out :)
